# HTool - NifBatchTools

Tool to batch .nif files, to apply glossiness and specular strength value to body parts (Head, body, hand, feet)

## Description

![Overview](res/img/tool.png)

This tool will scan specified folder to find relevant .nif files, in order to modify the glossiness and specular strength
of the body parts. To do so, the tool is looking in the .nif file, a block whose name is matching one of the provided keywords,
so that only body parts are affected. 

__Verified on Skyrim Legendary Edition and with UUNP meshes. It may works with Special Edition and CBBE bodies, but you
may have to adjust the keywords, so that the meshes are not ignored__

## Installation

### Requirements

Not a hard requirement, but if Nifskope is installed and set as the default program to open `.nif` files, you will be able to
automatically open files from the tool, by double-clicking on an item from a list view.

### From source
If you do not want to use the provided executables, you can launch the tool from the source code, available on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/Hyperen0r/HTool_NifBatchTools). See section __Tools/Libraries used__.

### From executables
Run anywhere.

## How to use

1. __Scan folders__ where .nif files are located. Preferably, the one where the meshes generated by bodyslide are generated.
Scan as many folders as you want.

2. Set desired __glossiness__ and __specular strength__

3. Click on __"Apply"__ and wait. The process is sadly quite slow.

4. __If NifSkope is installed and set as the default program to open `.nif` files, double-clicking on an item of a list view will open it, in NifSkope__

## F.A.Q

* __What are the default keywords ?__

_UUNP, FemaleHead, Hands, Feet, CL0, CL1_

* __How can I add keywords ?__

1. _Open htool.ini (located alongside the .exe. If not, run the tool once to generate the default one)._
2. _Add your entry to the list of keywords, e.g: `keywords= keywords1, your_keywords, ...`_

* __How can I set the default value for glossiness and specular strength ?__

1. _Open htool.ini (located alongside the .exe. If not, run the tool once to generate the default one)._
2. _Find those lines and modify accordingly :_
```
glossiness = 500.0
specularstrength = 5.0
```

* __My meshes is ignored/grey/red/not processed__

The goal of this tool is to affect only body parts. So by using keywords, only the block matching one of the keyword, 
will see his glossiness and specular strength to be modified. If you need a block to be processed, add his name to the
keywords (provided by the .ini file situated alongside the executable. If not, run the tool once to generate the 
default one). To find the name, you need to open the mesh with [NifSkope](https://github.com/niftools/nifskope/releases). 
You are looking for a block of type `NiTriShape` __(1)__ that, when selected, highlight the vertices of a body part __(2)__. 
The name is situated on the same line in the second column. See image below : ![How to find the name of a block, using NifSkope](res/img/find_name.png)

## Tools/Libraries used

* Python 3.7.4 (PyCharm IDE)
* [Pyffi](https://github.com/niftools/pyffi)
* [PySide2](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python)
* [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)

## Known problems

* __Applying patch is very slow__

_Sadly the plugin I used is very slow to read the .nif files (when calling data.read(stream), to be precise)_
